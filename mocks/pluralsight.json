Throughout these lessons we will go over using joints instead of the traditional approach of using blend shapes. We will be using locators and offset joints to attach to NURBs curves. These curves will be the foundation of how the rig works. It's very simple, and very effective. Once the rig is created the rig is re-usable on many different types of meshes.",

Using these new channels, we can control nodes such as a color corrector. We'll end by using the copy and shuffle copy to bring together multiple 3D render passes into channels in a single Node tree and then output a multi-channel EXR file for easier use later down the line. This series of lessons will illustrate the basics of the channel workflow inside of NUKE. By bringing together all of our image information into channels, we can then access that information at any point in the node tree. Software required: NUKE.",

    "Description": "In this course, Leveraging Advanced Networking and Load Balancing Services on the GCP, you will gain the ability to significantly reduce content-serving times using Google CDN, leverage DNS for authoritative name-serving, and gain all of the benefits of HTTPS load balancing for Kubernetes clusters using container-native load balancing. First, you will learn how Google CDN can be used to serve content to users from optimized web caches maintained by Google at its Points-of-presence throughout the world. These access points are at the edge of the Google network, and cache content based on specific keys. This is the same highly optimized technology that makes Youtube content so fast to load. You will implement CDN with an HTTP load balancer that has a backend cloud storage bucket and use that to cache images. Any cacheable service from the HTTP backend can be cached by Google CDN. Next, you will discover how to configure your domain with Google DNS. This is an authoritative DNS nameserver service which supports both public and private DNS zones. Your DNS records will reside in a highly available and scalable DNS serving network. Finally, you will explore how to combine two of the hottest services on the GCP - namely HTTP(S) load balancers and Kubernetes clusters. This is done using container-native load balancing, which configures an HTTP(S) load balancer to work with a specific type of backend known as a Network Endpoint Group. Network endpoint groups (NEGs) are zonal resources that represent collections of IP address and port combinations for GCP resources within a single subnet. Each IP address and port combination is called a network endpoint. Network endpoint groups can be used as backends in backend services for HTTP(S), TCP proxy, and SSL proxy load balancers. Because NEG backends allow you to specify IP addresses and ports, you can distribute traffic in a granular fashion among applications or containers running within VM instances. That is exactly what container-native load balancing does - it uses NEGs to distribute traffic across pods. When you’re finished with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge of powerful advanced features related to networking on the GCP, such as combining load balancers with backend buckets, backend instance groups and network endpoint groups to implement optimized serving of static content as well container-native load balancing.",

We'll then begin exploring how we can utilize concept sketching as part of the pipeline on a number of different types of projects. From a logo to a layout and even a character or environment design, concept sketching can take a number of different forms and we'll learn a little about each of them. We will wrap this course up by learning a few things that you can implement in order to be a more successful concept sketcher. This series of step-by-step videos were developed with artists new to concept sketching in mind so we will be moving at a steady, easy-to-follow pace making sure you understand terms and basic techniques.

Going through tutorial projects step by step is a really powerful way to learn the different modeling tools and techniques. We can see how those tools work as you follow along and create a specific model with your tutor. In the end, you will have created a specific model, but the real magic comes from being able to mentally break apart the different kinds of shapes you will encounter and find efficient methods for building those shapes - taking what you've learned and being able to apply those techniques to a different one. Now this knowledge and adaptability only comes from practice and experience with dealing with those situation as they arise. To simulate this, you'll be presented with a series of small modeling exercises. Each exercise consists of three lessons. The first lesson will be a review, where we will discuss a particular technique or workflow using a particular model. For the second lesson, we'll use a completely new model and provide instructions on how to come up with a solution for the exercise. Finally, in the third lesson, we'll discuss a possible solution for the previous exercise. Each exercise contains a series of hints but we encourage you not to look at those if you can help it. These exercises are your opportunity to practice what you've learned and gain the confidence that only comes from repetition and being able to address any issue that may come up.

We will start the training by taking a look at our game development document as well as the artwork that we have. These will give us a better idea of the technical aspects of our models and their look. We'll talk about building the geometry and creating texture maps for pieces of our level like old oil drums, boards and lights. We'll also cover workflows between Maya and Mudbox for modeling, sculpting, and painting bits of organic debris to illustrate the enemy infestation. We'll finish up by talking about dressing the set temporarily in Maya as a guide for the final dressing in Unity. So over the next hour and a half or so, we'll talk about creating the pieces necessary to dress our set and give it a realistic, aged and worn look. This course goes over the process for creating props and set dressing and the thoughts behind the decisions, but it is not a step-by-step tutorial. If you'd like to get up to speed on modeling in Maya, we'd recommend Introduction to Modeling in Maya, which goes over the tools we use here in greater detail. If you want a more step-by-step look at creating assets in Mudbox, we have a variety of trainings available, including Introduction to Mudbox 2012, which will get you started very quickly.
